And the following table describe the detail about each layers.

	Layer name		Description ~
	
	operation#command	It recieves <q-args> from |:Giit| command and
				parse to constructs an "args" instance. Then
				it calls:
				1. "operation#execute" to execute a git
				   command. Then it inform the result of the
				   command execution.
				2. "component#bufname" to create a component
				   buffer name. Then it opens the component
				   and let the component to perform further
				   process.
				When there is an operation{scheme}#command
				function, it calls that function and let that
				function to perform one of a step above.
				Otherwise it perform a step (1.) with a plain
				"args" instance.
	
	operation#execute	It recieves an "args" instance and executes a
				corresponding git command.
				When there is an operation#{scheme}#execute
				function, it calls that function and let that
				function to perform a git command. Otherwise
				it perform a git command directly from an
				"args" instance.
	
	component#bufname	It recieves an "args" instance and constructs
				a component buffer name.
				When there is a component#{scheme}#bufname
				function, it calls that function and let that
				function to construct a buffer name.
				Otherwise it construct a non-file component
				buffer name from {scheme}.

	component#autocmd	It recieves a "bufname" through |autocmd| and
				constructs an "args" instance. Then it calls
				"operation#execute" and use the result to
				construct the component content when for
				|BufReadCmd|.
				It requires a component#{scheme}#autocmd
				function.It calls that function and let that
				function to perform the process described
				above.
